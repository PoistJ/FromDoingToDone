# FromDoingToDone

OVERVIEW

This is a To Do app that should let the user add, delete, and organize their To Do items in different headings/lists. Users need to be able to organize by date or priority. They should also be able to add basic information like title, description, due date, priority, and notes to their To Do items.

There should be a basic overview of the user's To Do items in a project/heading, and clicking the item should expand it OR open a pop-up with more detailed information.

Functionality will potentially include being able to add sub-items/checklists to their To Do items.ÃŸ
